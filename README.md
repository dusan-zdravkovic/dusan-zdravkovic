- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dusan-zdravkovic;
Iâ€™m a recent Physics & Biochemistry grad who enjoys **applied modelling** and the computational side of data analysis. Im currently looking to use my skills in a **Data Science/Analyst** team position. The "first principles" approach I've learned from studying physics consisting of breaking down a problem into its fundamentals can be very useful in other contexts too. I also understand that real world data is messy with a stochastic element, which I also have a working knowledge in due to the nature of data in biophysics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my **Machine Learning** & **AI** skills with real-world data instead of exclusively experimental scientific data. Having a Mathematics Minor gives me a good background for machine learning since I've already studied Probability/Statistics, Linear Algebra, Multivariable calculus as well as some Miscellaneous topics as well.
