- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dusan-zdravkovic;
Iâ€™m a recent Physics & Biochemistry grad who enjoys **applied modelling** and the computational side of data analysis. Im currently looking to use my skills in a **Data Science/Analyst** team position. The "first principles approach" I've learned in physics consisting of breaking down a problem into its fundamentals is a convenient systematic way to understand and approach problems by reducing them to their most fundamental parts. I also understand that real world data is messy and stochastic, which I also have experience working due to the nature of data in biophysics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my **Machine Learning** & **AI** skills with real-world data instead of exclusively experimental scientific data.
