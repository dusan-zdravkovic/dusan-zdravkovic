- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dusan-zdravkovic,
Iâ€™m recent Physics & Biochemistry grad who enjoys **applied modelling** and the computational side of data analysis. Im currently looking to use my skills in a **Data Science/Analyst** team position. The "first principles approach" I've learned in physics consisting of breaking down a problem into it's fundamentals is a convenient systematic way to understand approach problems by reducing them to their most fundamental parts, but often real world data is messy and contains stochasity which is a biophysist's specialty.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my **Machine Learning** & **AI** skills with real-world data instead of exclusively experimental scientific data.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
