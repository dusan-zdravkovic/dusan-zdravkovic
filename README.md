ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dusan-zdravkovic;
Iâ€™m a recent Physics & Biochemistry grad who enjoys **applied modeling** and the computational side of data analysis. I'm currently looking to use my skills in a **Data Science/Analyst** team position. The "first principles" approach I've learned from studying physics, consisting of breaking down a problem into its fundamentals, can be very useful in other contexts too. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with the inherently messy and stochastic nature of real-world data, particularly through my work in biophysics.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my **Machine Learning** & **AI** skills with real-world data instead of exclusively experimental scientific data. Having a Mathematics Minor gives me a solid background for machine learning, as I've already studied Probability/Statistics, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, as well as some miscellaneous topics.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me at dusanz03@gmail.com.
